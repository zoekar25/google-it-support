## Data Recovery & Backups
**Latest Submission Grade: 90%**

<br>

### Question 1

What types of backup schemes are available? Check all that apply.

* **Full backup**
* **Differential backup**
* **Incremental backup**
* Partial backup 

> A full backup makes a copy of all files on each run. A differential backup starts with a full backup and only backs up changed files on each subsequent run. An incremental backup also begins with a full backup, but only backs up the portions of files that have changed on future runs.

<br>

### Question 2

What are the measures included in a disaster recovery plan?

* **Preventative**
* **Detection**
* Testing
* Recovery 

> A disaster recovery plan should incorporate preventative, detection, and recovery measures.

<br>

### Question 3

What's a commonly overlooked part of a post-mortem report?

* The summary
* The timeline
* What went poorly
* **What went well** 

> It's just as important to document the systems that worked correctly and helped to mitigate the disaster!

<br>

### Question 4

Which backup type only backs up files that have changed since the last run?

* Full backup
* **Differential backup**
* Incremental backup
* Partial backup 

> A differential backup only saves files that have changed since the last run.

<br>

### Question 5

What are advantages of on-site backups? Check all that apply.

* **There is quicker data access.**
* **Data is more secure because of less outbound traffic.**
* **There is less bandwidth usage.**
* Data is safe in case of disaster. 

<br>

### Question 6

Which of these are common backup tools you might consider when designing a backup solution? Check all that apply.

* **Time Machine**
* Regedit
* **Backup and Restore**
* **Rsync**

<br>

### Question 7

Which type of backup only saves copies of files that have been changed or created since the last backup?

* Differential backups [?]
* RAID array
* Incremental backup [INCORRECT]
* Complete backup 

<br>

### Question 8

Cloud services are the ideal backup option for user files. Which of these is not one of today's popular cloud storage platforms?

* Dropbox
* Google Drive
* **Rsync**
* Apple iCloud 

> Rsync is a command line tool used to compress and transfer files from one computer to another. While it is often used for backup, it's not a cloud service.

<br>

### Question 9

You are performing a network risk assessment to develop your disaster recovery plan. Which of these are examples of detection measures? Check all that apply.

* **Using an alert system for outages**
* **Testing your own (and users') knowledge and readiness for disaster**
* **Monitoring system testing**
* Conducting regular, automated backups 

<br>

### Question 10

What are some of the purposes of a post-mortem? Check all that apply.

* **To foster a culture where it's OK to make mistakes**
* Sharing post-mortems with other teams at an organization helps encourage a culture of learning from mistakes.
* **To understand the cause of mistakes and how to prevent them**
* To shame and punish mistakes
* **To learn from and adapt processes for higher efficiency**

### Question 11

When designing a data backup and recovery plan, what is the first thing to figure out?

* Future growth in data storage needs
* Encryption and bandwidth requirements
* How much total data you currently have
* **What data you need to backup

### Question 12

A data backup strategy needs to prioritize important data and only back up what is necessary for operations. Assuming storage limitations, which of these is LEAST important to back up?

* Emails
* Databases
* **User downloads
*Financial spreadsheets

### Question 13

Common concerns with backups are disk failure, lack of redundancy, and increasing disk capacity. Which backup method addresses these concerns?

* Differential backups
* Complete backup
* **RAID array
* Incremental backup

### Question 14

Which of the following issues often make reliable backups for client devices more challenging than for infrastructure devices? Select all that apply.

* **There are likely to be more client devices to backup compared to infrastructure devices.
* Infrastructure backups do not require complicated scheduling or configuration.
* Data stored on client devices is more valuable than data stored on infrastructure devices.
* **Many client devices are mobile and won't be in the office all the time.

### Question 15

Some steps of the disaster recovery plan might be time sensitive to ensure there is no data loss or equipment damage. Which element of the disaster recovery plan is designed to address this time sensitivity?

* Preventative measures
* Disciplinary measures
* Detection measures
* Corrective or recovery measures

### Question 16

Which of the following are components of a post-mortem report? Select all that apply.

* **An explanaition of resolution and recovery efforts
* All log data
* **A detailed timeline of key events
* **A brief samary
